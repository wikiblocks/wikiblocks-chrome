*This is a prototype Chrome extension developed for CS 316 (Database Systems) taught at Duke University in Fall 2015*

The extension uses information from a **Wikipedia** article to produce a list of relevant GitHub Gists (known as blocks) in the form of Mike Bostock's [many code examples](http://bl.ocks.org).

In addition, the extension adds blocks viewed on **bl.ocks.org** to a database of gists based on information contained in the description, *README.md*, and meta tags in *index.html*.

Check out [wikiblocks-search](https://github.com/bmershon/wikiblocks-search) for more information about the server side of the code.

# Quickstart

To install the extension, download the *[extension.crx](https://github.com/wikiblocks/wikiblocks-chrome/raw/master/extension.crx)* file and drag it into an open *chrome://extensions* window (navigate in the Chrome menu to Settings -> Extensions).

*Navigate to a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix) and click on the page action icon.*
