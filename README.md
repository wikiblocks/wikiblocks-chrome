The extension uses information from a Wikipedia article to produce a list of relevant GitHub Gists (known as blocks) in the form of Mike Bostock's [many code examples](http://bl.ocks.org).

*Note: The packed extension currently points at localhost:3000. The extension will be updated when the current search code is deployed agin.*

Check out [wikiblocks-search](https://github.com/bmershon/wikiblocks-search) for more information about how the extension gets relevant blocks.
